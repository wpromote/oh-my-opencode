export declare const BACKGROUND_TASK_DESCRIPTION = "Launch a background agent task that runs asynchronously.\n\nThe task runs in a separate session while you continue with other work. The system will notify you when the task completes.\n\nUse this for:\n- Long-running research tasks\n- Complex analysis that doesn't need immediate results\n- Parallel workloads to maximize throughput\n\nArguments:\n- description: Short task description (shown in status)\n- prompt: Full detailed prompt for the agent\n- agent: Agent type to use (any agent allowed)\n\nReturns immediately with task ID and session info. Use `background_output` to check progress or retrieve results.";
export declare const BACKGROUND_OUTPUT_DESCRIPTION = "Get output from a background task.\n\nArguments:\n- task_id: Required task ID to get output from\n- block: If true, wait for task completion. If false (default), return current status immediately.\n- timeout: Max wait time in ms when blocking (default: 60000, max: 600000)\n\nReturns:\n- When not blocking: Returns current status with task ID, description, agent, status, duration, and progress info\n- When blocking: Waits for completion, then returns full result\n\nIMPORTANT: The system automatically notifies the main session when background tasks complete.\nYou typically don't need block=true - just use block=false to check status, and the system will notify you when done.\n\nUse this to:\n- Check task progress (block=false) - returns full status info, NOT empty\n- Wait for and retrieve task result (block=true) - only when you explicitly need to wait\n- Set custom timeout for long tasks";
export declare const BACKGROUND_CANCEL_DESCRIPTION = "Cancel a running background task.\n\nOnly works for tasks with status \"running\". Aborts the background session and marks the task as cancelled.\n\nArguments:\n- taskId: Required task ID to cancel.";
