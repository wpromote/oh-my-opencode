Returns immediately with task_id.\n  The system will notify you when the task completes.\n  Use `background_output` tool with task_id to check progress (block=false returns full status info).\n- `run_in_background=false`: Task runs synchronously. Waits for completion and returns full result.\n\nUsage notes:\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless unless you provide a session_id\n4. Your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously\n5. Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research\n6. For long-running research tasks, use run_in_background=true to avoid blocking";
